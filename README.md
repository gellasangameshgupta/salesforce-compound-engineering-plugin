# SF Compound Engineering Plugin v3.1.0-beta.3

**Instruction-Based Compound Engineering for Salesforce** — a multi-platform plugin (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and 9 other AI coding tools) where each iteration becomes smarter than the last through institutional knowledge capture and parallel persona dispatch.

> **V3 is a skills-first architecture.** Commands were retired — every entry point is now a **skill** that auto-routes from natural-language phrases via its `description` frontmatter, with direct slash invocation (`/sf-<name>`) still supported. See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the migration guide from v2.x.

## The Compound Engineering Loop

```
  ┌─ HUMAN (taste) ─┐        ┌──────── AI (in the loop) ────────┐        ┌─ HUMAN (taste) ─┐
   Ideate · Brainstorm  →  Plan(40%) · Deepen · Work(20%) · Review · Resolve  →  Polish  →  Compound  →  Repeat

  • Ideate     — decide what's worth building (/sf-ideate)
  • Brainstorm — explore requirements through collaborative dialogue (/sf-brainstorm)
  • Plan       — research & design using 60 skills + parallel research personas (/sf-plan)
  • Deepen     — enhance the plan with section-level parallel research (/sf-deepen)
  • Work       — implement with pre-research + system-wide test checks (/sf-work)
  • Review     — parallel persona dispatch across 60 specialist personas (/sf-review)
  • Polish     — taste pass via /sf-polish: SLDS2/UX, accessibility (WCAG), copy (UI surfaces only)
  • Compound   — capture learnings to docs/solutions/, personas, skills, CLAUDE.md (/sf-compound)
```

> **The sandwich.** Humans own the two ends — **Ideate** (what's worth building) and **Polish** (does it feel right) — the "bread". The AI runs the middle "filling" in the loop. As models get better at execution, human attention concentrates where machines are still weak: taste and judgment.

> All nine core entry points (`/sf-ideate`, `/sf-brainstorm`, `/sf-plan`, `/sf-deepen`, `/sf-work`, `/sf-review`, `/sf-polish`, `/sf-compound`, `/sf-lfg`) are **skills** in V3 — they auto-route from natural-language phrases via their `description` frontmatter, and direct slash invocation continues to work.

Above the loop, **`/sf-strategy`** maintains an optional repo-root `STRATEGY.md` (target problem, approach, users, key metrics, tracks) that `sf-ideate`, `sf-brainstorm`, and `sf-plan` read as grounding when it exists.

**Each iteration starts smarter** because learnings compound into `docs/solutions/`, personas, skills, and CLAUDE.md.

> **Principles.** This plugin is opinionated. Seven principles — preserve the quality ceiling, verifiability, stay in the loop, the spec is the artifact, taste over typing, agent-native docs, outsource thinking not understanding — govern every skill and every review. See [`PRINCIPLES.md`](./PRINCIPLES.md). Each core workflow skill declares which principles it enforces.

> **Agentless note (V3.1):** the plugin ships **no standalone agents**, so the *Agents* column is empty in practice — the converters still exist but iterate an empty set. Specialist **personas** travel inside `skills/` (under `references/personas/`) and are converted as part of each skill, reaching every platform.

## Workflow Entry Points

The nine-step compound loop, plus the full-pipeline runner and the strategy grounding skill:

| Skill            | Stage      | Purpose                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/sf-strategy`   | grounding  | Create/maintain repo-root `STRATEGY.md` read by ideate/brainstorm/plan |
| `/sf-ideate`     | bread      | Decide what's worth building — grounded idea generation             |
| `/sf-brainstorm` | loop       | Explore requirements through collaborative dialogue                 |
| `/sf-plan`       | loop       | Research & design specs with parallel persona research (NO CODE)      |
| `/sf-deepen`     | loop       | Enhance plan sections with parallel deep research                   |
| `/sf-work`       | loop       | Implement with pre-research, skills routing, and test checks        |
| `/sf-review`     | loop       | Review with parallel persona dispatch (fast/thorough/comprehensive)   |
| `/sf-polish`     | bread      | Stack-aware UI polish — SLDS2/UX, WCAG accessibility, copy          |
| `/sf-compound`   | loop       | Capture learnings to `docs/solutions/` with YAML schema             |
| `/sf-lfg`        | pipeline   | Full autonomous pipeline — ideate through deploy in one command     |

Plus utility skills: `/sf-simplify-code`, `/sf-product-pulse`, `/sf-debug`, `/sf-doc-review`, `/sf-optimize`, `/sf-resolve-pr-feedback`, `/sf-commit`, `/sf-commit-push-pr`, `/sf-pr-description`, `/sf-release-notes`, `/sf-report-bug`, `/sf-sessions`, `/sf-setup`, and more.

### `/sf-lfg` — The Full Pipeline

```
Ideate → Brainstorm → Plan → Deepen → Work → Review → Resolve → Polish → Test → Deploy → Compound
```

Each stage has gates that must pass before proceeding. The pipeline aborts and asks for input on security regressions, governor regressions, repeated test failures, or deployment validation problems.

```bash
/sf-lfg "Lead auto-assignment flow based on territory" --deploy=scratch
```

## Specialist Personas (60)

V3.1 is **agentless** — there are no standalone registered agents. The 60 specialist personas are prompt assets under `skills/<owner>/references/personas/<name>.md`, dispatched by the workflow skills as **isolated subagents**: parallel with isolated context on Claude Code, applied inline on harnesses without a subagent primitive. They ship to every platform as ordinary skill files. Primary owners: `sf-review` (code review), `sf-doc-review` (doc review), `sf-plan` (research). Topical groupings:

| Group                      | Covers                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apex**                   | Governor limits, security (CRUD/FLS, injection), bulkification, triggers, test coverage, exceptions |
| **LWC**                    | Architecture, performance, security (XSS/Locker), accessibility, Aura migration |
| **Flow & Automation**      | Flow governor limits, complexity, Flow-vs-Apex strategy, validation rules    |
| **Integration**            | REST API design, callout patterns, Platform Events, integration security, MCP config & tool builder |
| **Architecture & Data**    | Data model, sharing/OWD security, pattern recognition, metadata consistency  |
| **Research**               | Learnings, best practices, git history, repo conventions, framework docs     |
| **Workflow**               | Spec/flow analysis, bug reproduction, PR comment resolution, simplicity, deployment verification |
| **Review personas**        | Correctness, maintainability, testing, project-standards (always-on) + conditional personas (adversarial, security, performance, reliability, API contract, data migration, …) |

| `permission-set-generate` | Least-privilege permission sets                               |

### Agentforce & Prompt Builder

| Skill                | Use When                                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agentforce-develop` | Build, modify, debug, deploy Agentforce agents — Agent Spec gate, `.agent` authoring, publish/activate |
| `agentforce-test`    | Smoke + batch testing — `sf agent preview` traces, Testing Center YAML, fix loop |
| `agentforce-observe` | Production observation — STDM session traces in Data Cloud (with fallback) |
| `prompt-builder`     | Prompt templates — metadata XML, merge fields, grounding, deployment    |

> **⚠️ Agentforce DX Critical Notes (April–May 2026):**
> - **`topic` is deprecated.** Use `subagent`, `start_agent agent_router:`, and `@subagent.name` everywhere.
> - **Default preview = simulated.** Without `--use-live-actions`, real Apex is never called. `--mode live` does not exist — the correct flag is `--use-live-actions`.
> - **Debug logs → Agent User, not admin.** Apex runs as the Einstein Agent User; setting debug logs on your admin account produces nothing.
> - **API version must match your org.** Spring '26 = `66.0`, Summer '26 = `67.0`. Mismatches cause `Invalid api version` errors.
> - **Multi-component deploys need Package XML.** Use `--manifest manifest/package.xml`, not `--metadata`. The metadata type is `AiAuthoringBundle`.

### Hosted MCP

| Skill                | Use When                                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hosted-mcp-servers` | Hosted MCP setup, ECA configuration, URL patterns, security model, troubleshooting |
| `mcp-tool-builder`   | Building custom MCP tools — Apex `@InvocableMethod`, Flows, Named Queries, prompt templates |

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `sf-cli`              | Deploy, retrieve, test, org management         |
| `compound-docs`       | Writing solution documents with YAML schema    |
| `file-todos`          | File-based task tracking                        |

## Knowledge System

Learnings are captured in `docs/solutions/` with YAML frontmatter and organized by category:

```
docs/solutions/
├── governor-limit-issues/   # Limit handling patterns
├── deployment-issues/       # CI/CD and deployment fixes
├── test-failures/           # Test troubleshooting guides
├── security-issues/         # Security implementations
├── integration-issues/      # External system patterns
├── flow-issues/             # Automation solutions
├── lwc-issues/              # Component solutions
├── data-model-issues/       # Schema design decisions
├── best-practices/          # Proven patterns and approaches
└── patterns/                # Reusable code patterns
```

The `sf-learnings-researcher` persona searches these documents by frontmatter metadata before every plan and implementation phase to surface relevant institutional knowledge. `docs/solutions/`, `docs/plans/`, and `docs/brainstorms/` are **protected directories** — edit, never delete.

## MCP Integration

Configured in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.context7.com/mcp"
    },
    "salesforce-dx": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@salesforce/mcp", "--orgs", "DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG", "--toolsets", "all"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Context7** — framework documentation, used by research personas as the second tier after local skills, before falling back to web search.

**Salesforce DX MCP** — live org operations (SOQL, deploy, retrieve, code analysis, LWC experts, testing). Toolsets: `core`, `orgs`, `metadata`, `data`, `users`, `code-analysis`, `lwc-experts`, `aura-experts`, `experts-validation`, `devops`, `enrichment`, `mobile`, `testing`, `scale-products`.

> **Prerequisites for Salesforce DX MCP:** Authorize an org first with `sf org login web`. The server uses `DEFAULT_TARGET_ORG` — whatever you set with `sf config set target-org`.

***

## Requirements

* Claude Code (or another supported AI coding tool)
* Node.js (for MCP servers)
* Bun (for the CLI installer)
